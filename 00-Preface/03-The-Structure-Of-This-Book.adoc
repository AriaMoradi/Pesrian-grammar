## The Structure of This Book
This book is inspired by *Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar*(TODO: put link to website) and tries to be a simple yet practical guide to the Persian grammar, the material is sorted by usefulness and simplicity in a way that makes sense to me.
You will find the book devided in 4 levels of difficulty: Absolute beginner, Begginer, Intermidiate, Advanced.
