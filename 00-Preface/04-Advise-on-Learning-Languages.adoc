## Advise on learning languages
TODO
- you should not try to memorise the grammar
- you should not by learning grammar try to constantly monitor yourself
- you dont learn grammar, you get used to it.
- you will eventually generate correct structered language by getting enough exposure to the correct structured language enough times
- it's best to use a grammar book as a refrence
- the best method to learn a lanugage is lots and lots of listening and reading in the form of "comprehensible input", for more information on this method google "Steven Krashen" and "comprehensible input" or check out the refrences section.
